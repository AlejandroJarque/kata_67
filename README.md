## In this Kata, I've created a function to count the number of times a vowel appears in a string. To do this, I've created a function that takes the string and an array of vowels as parameters. Inside the function, I first iterate through the string using a for loop, and then iterate through the array of vowels using a nested foreach loop. Within the foreach loop, I compare each position of the string with the array of vowels, and if they match, I add them to a second array of vowels. Outside the function, I simply create a variable with the function's value and pass it through the `array_count_values` function, which returns the exact count of each vowel.
